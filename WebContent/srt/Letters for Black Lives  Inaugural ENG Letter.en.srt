1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,100
Mom,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
Dad,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,500
Uncle, Auntie,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,800
Grandfather, Grandmother:

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,680
We need to talk.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,670
You may not have grown up around
people who are Black, but I have

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,260
Black people are a fundamental 
part of my life:

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,940
They’re my friends,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,779
my roommates,

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,740
my classmates and teammates,

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,049
my family

12
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:36,200
Today, I’m scared for them

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,170
This year, the American police have 
already killed more than 500 people

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:49,330
Of those, 25% have been black, even though
they only make up 13% of the population

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,210
Earlier this week in Louisiana two police
officers killed a man named Alton Sterling

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,760
while he sold CDs on the street

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,940
The very next day in Minnesota, 
a police officer shot and killed

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,660
a Black man named Philando Castile

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,250
in his car during a traffic stop

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,370
while his girlfriend and her
four year-old daughter looked on

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,950
Overwhelmingly, the police do not face any
consequences for ending these lives

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,740
This is a terrifying reality that some of
my closest friends live with every day

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,510
Even as we hear about the dangers
that Black Americans face

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,260
our instinct is to sometimes point at all
the ways that we’re different from them

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,330
To shield ourselves from their reality, 
rather than empathizing

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,240
When a policeman shoots a Black person
you might think it’s the victim’s fault

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,180
because you see so many images of them 
in the media as thugs and criminals

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,740
After all, you might say,

29
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,309
we managed to come to
America and build good lives

30
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,559
for ourselves despite discrimination,

31
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,510
so why can’t they?

32
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,760
I want to share with you
how I see things

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,710
It’s true that we face discrimination for
being Asian in this country.

34
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,900
Sometimes people are rude to us about our
accents,

35
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,900
or withhold promotions because they don’t
think of us as leadership material

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,030
Some of us are told we’re terrorists

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,360
But for the most part, people 
don’t think “dangerous criminal”

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,259
when we are walking down the street

39
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:28,109
The police do not gun down our children
and parents for simply existing

40
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,730
This is not the case for our Black friends

41
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:36,029
Many Black people were brought to 
America as slaves against their will

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,200
For centuries their communities, families,
and bodies were ripped apart for profit

43
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,800
Even after slavery, they had to build 
back their lives by themselves

44
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,610
with no institutional support –

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,419
not allowed to vote or own homes,

46
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,219
and constantly under the threat of
violence that continues to this day

47
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,399
In fighting for their own rights, Black 
activists have led the movement

48
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:06,400
for opportunities not just for 
themselves, but for us as well

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,770
Black people have been 
beaten, jailed, even killed

50
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,389
fighting for many of the rights that 
Asian Americans enjoy today

51
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,010
We owe them so much in return

52
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,450
We are all fighting against 
the same unfair system

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,560
that prefers we compete 
against each other

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,599
When someone is walking home and gets
shot by a sworn protector of the peace

55
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,239
–even if that person’s last name is Liang–

56
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,289
that is an assault on all of us,

57
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:42,809
and on all of our hopes for equality
and fairness under the law

58
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:48,059
For all these reasons I support 
the Black Lives Matter movement

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,260
Part of that support means
speaking up when I see people

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,330
in my own community 
–or even my own family–

61
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,410
say or do things that 
diminish the humanity

62
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,830
of Black Americans in this country

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,780
I’m telling you this out of love, because
I don’t want this issue to divide us

64
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,800
I’m asking you to try and empathize 
with the anger and grief of the fathers,

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,589
mothers, and children who have lost 
their loved ones to police violence

66
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,640
To empathize with my anger and grief

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:32,280
To support me if I choose
to be vocal and to protest

68
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,640
To share this letter with your friends and
to encourage them to be empathetic, too

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,730
As your child, I am proud 
and eternally grateful

70
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,810
that you took the long, 
hard journey to this country,

71
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,840
that you've lived decades in a place
that hasn’t always been kind to you

72
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,070
You’ve never wished your 
struggles upon me

73
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,260
Instead, you’ve suffered through 
a prejudiced America,

74
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,620
to bring me closer to 
the American Dream

75
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,360
But I hope you can consider this:

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,570
The American Dream cannot
exist only for your children

77
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,810
We’re all in this together 
and we cannot be safe

78
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,480
until all of our friends, loved 
ones, and neighbors are safe

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,689
The American Dream that we seek

80
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:26,989
is a place where all Americans can
live without fear of police violence

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,010
This is the future that I want –
and one that I hope you want, too

82
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,210
With love and hope,

83
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,860
Your chidren
